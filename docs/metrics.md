- **Formula**: `AVG(time_from_waitlist_entry_to_seating)`
- **Purpose**: Measure customer experience and operational efficiency
- **Target**: < 15 minutes for popular games

#### **Revenue per Hour**

- **Formula**: `SUM(rake_collected) / hours_operated`
- **Purpose**: Track financial performance
- **Components**: Rake, tournament fees, side games

#### **Player Retention**

- **Formula**: `(returning_players / total_players) * 100`
- **Purpose**: Measure customer loyalty and satisfaction
- **Timeframes**: Daily, weekly, monthly retention rates

### Game-Level Metrics

#### **Fill Rate**

- **Formula**: `(current_players / max_players) * 100`
- **Purpose**: Monitor game demand and table efficiency
- **Target**: 80-90% fill rate for active games

#### **Turnover Rate**

- **Formula**: `players_per_hour`
- **Purpose**: Measure game activity and player flow
- **Calculation**: Total players seated / hours game was active

#### **Average Session Length**

- **Formula**: `AVG(end_time - start_time)`
- **Purpose**: Understand player engagement and game dynamics

  - Cash games: 2-4 hours
  - Tournaments: 3-6 hours

#### **Peak Hours**

- **Metrics**: Hourly player counts and game activity
- **Purpose**: Optimize staffing and table allocation
- **Visualization**: Heat maps showing activity by hour/day

### Table-Level Metrics

#### **Utilization Rate**

- **Formula**: `(current_players / seat_count) * 100`
- **Purpose**: Monitor individual table performance
- **Target**: 85-95% utilization for active tables

#### **Revenue per Table**

- **Formula**: `rake_generated / table_hours`
- **Purpose**: Identify most profitable tables and games
- **Components**: Rake, side bets, tournament fees

#### **Average Occupancy**

- **Formula**: `AVG(players_per_hour) over time_period`
- **Purpose**: Long-term table performance analysis
- **Timeframes**: Daily, weekly, monthly averages

### Player-Level Metrics

#### **Session History**

- **Data Points**: Games played, buy-ins, session duration
- **Purpose**: Track player preferences and behavior patterns
- **Privacy**: Anonymized for analytics, detailed for individual players

#### **Preferred Games**

- **Metrics**: Most played game types, stakes, times
- **Purpose**: Personalized recommendations and marketing
- **Calculation**: Frequency and duration by game type

#### **Average Buy-in**

- **Formula**: `AVG(buy_in_amount)`
- **Purpose**: Understand player spending patterns
- **Segmentation**: By game type, time of day, player tier

#### **Visit Frequency**

- **Metrics**: Days between visits, total visits per month
- **Purpose**: Identify VIP players and at-risk customers
- **Categories**: Daily, weekly, monthly, occasional players

-- Returns: operators, games, tables, waitlist_entries, tournaments

-- Single adaptable function for game stats
get_game_stats(game_id, include_inactive = false, time_period = 'today')
-- Returns: current_players, waitlist_count, revenue, session_count
```

#### **Analytics Functions**

```sql
-- Room analytics
get_room_analytics(room_id, time_period = 'today')
-- Returns: utilization, revenue, popular_games, player_activity

-- Game analytics
get_game_analytics(game_id, time_period = 'today')
-- Returns: fill_rate, turnover, avg_session_length, peak_hours

-- Player analytics
get_player_analytics(player_id, time_period = '30_days')
-- Returns: session_count, preferred_games, avg_buy_in, frequency
```

### Database Structure

#### **Optimized Tables**
